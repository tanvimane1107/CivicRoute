Demo video narration script for CivicRoute.
Hello everyone, this is CivicRoute — a smart city solution designed to improve traffic management and road construction awareness.

Urban areas often face traffic congestion due to unplanned or poorly communicated road construction. CivicRoute solves this by connecting citizens and authorities on a single platform.

The home screen shows an interactive map highlighting active and upcoming road construction zones. Users can search routes and receive traffic alerts before starting their journey.

Citizens can report new road construction or roadblocks by selecting a location, adding basic details, and submitting the report through the app.

On the authority side, the dashboard allows officials to verify citizen reports, manage construction projects, and update road status in real time.

By providing transparent communication between citizens and government authorities, CivicRoute helps reduce congestion, save time, and improve urban mobility.

Thank you.
