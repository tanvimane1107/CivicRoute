# CivicRoute
CivicRoute is a government–citizen collaborative web platform that displays live and planned road construction zones, helps commuters plan routes in advance, and reduces traffic congestion through transparent communication.

# CivicRoute 🚧

## Overview
CivicRoute is a government–citizen collaborative web platform designed to reduce traffic congestion caused by uncommunicated road construction activities.

The platform enables citizens to view active and planned construction zones on a map, plan routes accordingly, and report unlisted road work. Authorities can manage construction data, verify reports, and communicate updates transparently.

## Problem Statement
Road construction is necessary but often poorly communicated. Citizens encounter roadblocks unexpectedly, leading to traffic congestion, fuel waste, and emergency delays.

## Proposed Solution
CivicRoute bridges this communication gap by providing a centralized, public-facing platform that visualizes construction zones and traffic impact in advance.

## Features
- Interactive map with construction markers
- Route planning with alerts
- Citizen reporting system
- Government authority dashboard
- Real-time status updates

## Tech Stack
- Google Maps API
- Firebase (Firestore, Authentication, Cloud Storage)
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Project Status
This repository currently contains the project design, architecture, and conceptual MVP mockups.  
Implementation is planned as a future enhancement.

## Hackathon
This project was developed as part of a hackathon to demonstrate a scalable smart-city solution.
